# Netflix Family Usage Analysis
This project explores how a family uses their Netflix account, identifying patterns in viewing habits, binge-watching tendencies, favorite shows, and the effectiveness of Netflix messages. The analysis dives into user behavior and highlights actionable insights.

## Motivation
Have you ever wondered how each family member uses a shared Netflix account?
**Which profiles are the most active?**
**Who’s the biggest binge-watcher?**
**Which shows are universally loved across the family?**
**Do Netflix messages actually influence users to watch more?**
This analysis answers all of these questions and more, offering actionable insights for optimizing user experiences and making informed decisions about profile management.
